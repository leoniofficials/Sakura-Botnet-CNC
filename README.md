# Sakura Botnet — CNC Overview

**English**

**Overview:**  
This document describes the purpose and architecture of a Command-and-Control (C&C / CNC) system named **Sakura**, intended for CentOS 6 or 7 VPS environments. Sakura models an IRC-style management system whose primary function is to coordinate distributed agents (bots) from a central server.

**Main Function:**  
The CNC server issues commands to connected agents and coordinates their activities. Example connection names/ports are illustrative; no deployment or usage instructions are provided here.

**Use Cases:**  
- **Agent Management:** Coordinating groups of remote agents to perform collective tasks such as system information collection (illustrative).  
- **DDoS Simulation (testing only):** Simulating traffic in isolated, authorized test environments to evaluate network resilience.  
- **Research & Scanning (research-only):** Using isolated resources to study scanning behaviors and detection methods.  
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Centralized logging for analysis and incident review (example log filename references may exist for analysis purposes).

**Technical Shape (non-technical):**  
Source components are typically written in languages like C for agent code and may use helper scripts for packaging. Tool names may be present in repository filenames; this README does not provide build or runtime instructions.

**Intended Purpose & Warning:**  
Sakura is intended solely for **research, security education, and detection practice**. This project must be tested **only in isolated and authorized test environments** (e.g., offline labs, virtual machines you control). **Do not use for unauthorized or harmful activities.**
